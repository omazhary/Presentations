### Research Questions

1. How is information propagated within the contribution process?
2. How does information propagation affect people's perception of project health?

### Continuous Software Engineering

> "Continuous software engineering refers to the organizational capability to develop, release, and learn from software in rapid parallel cycles."
J. Bosch, “Continuous software engineering: An introduction,” in Continuous Software Engineering. Springer, 2014, pp. 3–13.

+++

### Continuous Integration (CI)

1. Retrieve source code
2. Compile source code
3. Execute:
    - Unit Tests
    - Integration Tests
    - Regression Tests
    - Static Analysis
4. Provide feedback

+++

### Continuous Delivery (CDE)

- Extends CI
- Adds the concept of a _Staging Environment_
- A successful build from a CI system will result in a production-ready release (if required by developer)

+++

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

- Extends CDE
- Adds the ability to deploy to a customer environment (i.e., _production_)
- A.K.A. _The Pipeline_

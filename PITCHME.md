### Introduction to CI

> "Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently leading to multiple integrations per day.
> Each integration is verified by an automated build to detect integration errors as quickly as possible." - Martin Fowler

### Research Domains

- Build- and Test Time Reduction
- Visibility and Awareness of CI Results
- Semi-Automated Continuous Testing
- Violations, Flaws, and Faults in CI
- Security and Scalability Issues in Pipelines
- Reliability of the Deployment Process
